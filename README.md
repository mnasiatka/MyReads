# MyReads Project

__MyReads__ is a React application created with the use of _create-react-app_. This application allows you to search our library of books and add them to your bookshelf in one of three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. You are also able to move books between your shelves as you see fit. 

## Running the Project

To install and start the app do the following:
* Clone the repository locally
* Open the resulting _MyReads_ folder in a command terminal
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run app with `npm start`
